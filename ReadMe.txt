The Macintosh game Airborne! was released in 1984 by Silicon Beach Software. The programmer was Johnathan Gay. From an interview with Jonathan in 2011 he said:

"Airborne was mostly written in 68000 assembly code with some Pascal for the starting screen. Airborne! was one of the first games to have digitized sound. The sound work was done by Eric Zocher."

This project is an attempt to port Airborne! (which was one of my favorite Macintosh games) to the modern browser using JavaScript and HTML5/canvas.
